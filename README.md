# project4

*  A new environment was created to format the collection of data car sales. We called info to clean up and duplicates and or get rid of or correct missing values.

*  This project has several packages installed to help assist the readability of the information withing the charts. Ex pandas, plotyexpress, scipy, numpy. When you scroll over some of the plot charts you will see certain values pop up next to each dot your curser hovers.

*  After cleaning the data we started to form the information around what potential clients are drawn to, price, model, miles etc. 

*  Taking these values or columns we've displayed several charts that would compare them side by side to help the consumer withdraw what is important to them.

*  A github was created to upload the information and saved publically to make it accessible for further updates and edits and record history.

*  After saving it on github it ran through streamlit process and used render to make it applicable to the public.

        *  Rendered application link: https://project4-hr3g.onrender.com
        *  Github URL: https://github.com/mtascione001/project4

*  This final render should make the application easily readable in order for the consumer to scroll through and navigate their options. This simplicity will set the consumers decision making at ease.
